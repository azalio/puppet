# Puppet Control Repo
  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vladgh/puppet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vladgh/puppet)

## Development status ##
This project is still in a prototype development stage.

## Overview
Vlad's Puppet Control Repo.

## Description
### bin/
Contains various executable scripts.

### cfn/
Contains AWS CloudFormation templates.

### dist/
Contains organization-specific roles and profiles.
This directory is specified as a modulepath in environment.conf
[Designing Puppet â€“ Roles and Profiles.](http://www.craigdunn.org/2012/05/239/)

### hieradata/
Contains the hiera data files. It's intended to serve as a base only, for
public data, with sane defaults. It should be overwritten or amended with data
from private sources.

### include/
Contains various functions that can be sourced in other scripts.

### manifests/
Contains Puppet's manifests:
  - `site.pp`: the main manifest

### Puppetfile
r10k needs this file to figure out what component modules you want from the
Forge. The result is a modules directory containing all the modules specified in
this file, for each environment/branch. The modules directory is listed in
environment.conf's modulepath.

### environment.conf
This file can override several settings whenever the Puppet master is serving
nodes assigned to that environment.
[Config Files: environment.conf](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/config_file_environment.html)

### defaults.env
This file contains global variables. **All
variables declared here are public**. Any sensitive information should be
placed in an `.env` file which will overwrite the information here.

## Testing
### Prerequisites

- Vagrant: https://www.vagrantup.com/
- Docker: https://www.docker.com/
- RVM: https://rvm.io/
- GIT: https://git-scm.com/

```
cd dist/profile
bundle install
```

### Unit testing
```
cd dist/profile
bundle exec rake test
```

#### Acceptance testing

`cd dist/profile`

List nodes:

`bundle exec rake beaker_nodes`

Run default set for the first time (default creates all nodes)

`bundle exec rake acceptance PUPPET_INSTALL_TYPE=agent BEAKER_destroy=no`

Subsequent runs

`bundle exec rake acceptance PUPPET_INSTALL_TYPE=agent BEAKER_destroy=no BEAKER_provision=no`

Last run (will destroy the machines)

`bundle exec rake acceptance PUPPET_INSTALL_TYPE=agent BEAKER_provision=no`

The following environment variables can be used to influence how beaker works:

* `BEAKER_color`: set to `no` to disable color output
* `BEAKER_set`: choose a nodeset from `spec/acceptance/nodesets/*.yml`; defaults to `default`
* `BEAKER_setfile`: specify a nodeset using a full path
* `BEAKER_provision`: set to `no` to re-use existing VMs
* `BEAKER_keyfile`: specify alternate SSH key
* `BEAKER_debug`: set to any value to enable beaker debug logging
* `BEAKER_destroy`: set to `no` to keep the VMs after the test run. Set to `onpass` to keep the VMs around only after a test failure.

### Clean-up
```
cd dist/profile
bundle exec rake test_clean
```
